# Open Ventilator Registry
The Open Ventilator Registry project is answering [the call](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/opinion/health/ventilator-shortage-coronavirus-solution.html) to provide a cloud-based national registry of ventilators and the hospitals that need them most
in order to facilitate their distribution during the COVID19 pandemic.  Even with a ramp up in ventilator production, there is still the significant problem 
of their efficient distribution.  

The Open Ventilator Registry is calling on software engineers, UX designers, doctors, hospital staff and medical equipment manufacturers to help build a platform for hospitals to overcome the critical shortage of ventilators.  We aim to create a nimble and decentralized supply chain and distribution network of these life saving devices.

We have registered the domain www.openventilatorregistry.org and will deploy the web application there when it is ready.

### How to Help

Join our Slack channel to meet others interested in helping and learn about what's currently being worked on.  Look at the open issues, create your own if you have an idea, submit pull requests to the right projects.

### Central Communication Channel

There is a central communication Slack workspace for this project.

Please reach out if you are looking to get involved!

### Teams
There are two teams: UI and Backend.  Each team has its own section within this organization.  Each team can create repos and manage their projects.

### Tech Stack

We're open to whatever technologies will make us most effective.

### Attitude

Time is of the essence.  Many projects get bogged down with disagreements over technologies, coding style, frameworks,
and methodologies.  We will not let any individual's sense of perfection get in the way of what's good enough to get the job
done.  We believe our work will help save lives, and we want to save as many as we can.

March 22nd, 2020 is day 1 of this project.  [According to some public officials, we will be in crisis in 10 days](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/coronavirus-update-de-blasio-says-nyc-10-days-away-from-widespread-shortages-of-critical-medical-equipment/ar-BB11xrvg?li=BBnb7Kz).
