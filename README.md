# OpenVentilatorRegistry
The Open Ventilator Registry project is answering the call to provide a cloud-based national registry of ventilators and the hospitals that need them most
in order to facilitate their distribution during the COVID19 pandemic.  Even with a ramp up in ventilator production, there is still the significant problem 
of their efficient distribution.  

The Open Ventilator Registry is calling on software engineers to help build a platform for hospitals to report on their stock of ventilators and if they have a surplus
or deficit.  Hospitals with a surplus can then send their supply to hospitals in greatest need.  We aim to create a nimble and decentralized supply chain and 
distribution network of these life saving devices.
